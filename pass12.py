#
#    # The address allocation for instructions is completed, providing placeholders for machine code translation.
#
#    # Pass 1 does not generate executable machine code, but it lays the groundwork for Pass 2, where the actual translation of symbolic instructions into machine code occurs.
#
#    # Without Pass 1, we wouldnâ€™t have the necessary information to handle labels and addresses during the actual code generation in Pass 2, making it a crucial first step in the two-pass assembly process.
